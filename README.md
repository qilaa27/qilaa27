# Hi, I'm Renata Aqila! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate Data Science student at **BINUS University** passionate about:
- ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- ðŸ“Š Data Visualization & Analysis 

My daily toolkit includes **Python**, **C**, and **R** for building programs and managing data. I develop machine learning and deep learning models using **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**, and love transforming raw data into insights with **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Streamlit**.

For web development, I build dynamic applications with **FastAPI**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, while refining interfaces with **Figma** for a smooth user experience.
